We consider data on returns of two market assets and of a risk-free asset.
We first consider a univariate dynamic capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and provide estimates and forecasts by MLE and in a Bayesian approach.
And then we study the two market assets jointly, through a bivariate extension of the dynamic CAPM given by a seemingly unrelated regression model.
